Intro to bits and basic logic gates

TODO:
- Probably need a bit of an overarching intro that explains:
   CPU
   RAM
   PERIFERALS I/O
- Explain the nature of the cycle
- get an instruction
- get data
- process it
- depending on the result do something else
- or go and read the next line of the program

(this way starting from the ALU is better)

- Mentioned von neuman at some point

- Remove the quotation that says that this will be mainly about the how do It know

- Make some explanation about the canonical representation of the gates and explain 
why and and or are the only thing necessary things


POST 2
- Use the canonical representation as a segway to explain why we're treating some of the following components as blackboxes
- Now I need to talk about the delay and timers?
- The table here is actually wrong needs to account for delay see 
- Explain situation about a loop that feed on it self.

ALU POST
- All programs can be reduced to a simple number of basic operation
- As example we have the following loop
