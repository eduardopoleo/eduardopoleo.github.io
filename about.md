Hey thanks for visiting my blog. I'm a software developer located in Toronto. 

Hey ðŸ‘‹! Thanks for visiting my site. My name is Eduardo I'm a software developer based in Toronto. I mostly do Ruby and JavaScript at and I like to write about programming. Since you're here already I might as well share a few facts about me:

Software Development Experience: Most of my experience has been at established SAAS / B2BC companies within multidisciplinary teams. Because these companies already have a big complex system we tent to prioritize code quality and scalability over development speed. My time is normally split ~ 50 / 50 between customer facing features and tech debt work. I enjoy them equally and think that both have their unique challenges.

Tech I'm well experienced in. They feel at home and that been using for several years on a daily basis. I commonly stay on top of their latest developments and occasionally look into its libraries / internals. Basically, my bread and butter.
Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Rspec

Tech I'm proficient at. I use them on a regular basis at work and I feel very comfortable with them. Learning a new framework or concept related to them is never a problem since I have a clear understanding of their use-cases and philosophies.
CSS, Javascript, React + <insert X state management library>, JQuery, Git.

Tech I've used when needed. I've used them circumstantially at work to solve the occasional lower level pesky issue. While I do not consider myself proficient at them I know them enough to be dangerous when required.
Postgres, Mysql, AWS, docker, CI (gitlab, github)

Tech I'm learning. I look into them for fun and side projects such my blog and others.
Firebase, Three.js, Svelte, Jekyll

Fun Fact. I once optimized a script runtime from 40+ days down to 1.5 days without writing a single line of code. This radically changed the release strategy of a core upcoming feature of the company.

Editor: I use Sublime.

Hot takes:
- Micro-services are overrated and most teams / companies do not need them or know how to run them. If your monolith sucks chances are that this is due to poor code quality, unoptimized code, bad architecture / modelling, bad processes etc. Splitting your system logic across different apps won't solve ANY of these problems.
- Commit messages should be detailed regardless on whether you already have the info in your favorite CMS / ticketing system or not, things like "MY-JIRA-PROJECT-123: I did something" does not cut it. Their emphasis should be on explaining WHY you made the change as oppose to how or what you did which (hopefully) should be obvious from the implementation.
- Programming books are largely irrelevant. The most efficient learning happens JIT (just in time) right when you need something done. If you need to research anything the web is your best friend.
- Academic background is largely irrelevant. This is not even a hot take anymore large companies like Google and Apple have already removed their CS degree requirements from their career postings.
- Absolute (and for the most part baseless) tech comparisons are a waste of time. E.g framework / language / pattern / methodology x is better than y framework / language / pattern / methodology. Different problems required different solutions and when all things considered are equal developer / team proficiency with the tech(s) involved trumps any other metric.
